module.exports = (API) => ({
  project: {
    name: 'My API',
    port: 3000
  },
  database: {
    uri: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp'
  },
  routes: (r) => [
    r.post('/users(Users)', { c: true }),
    r.get('/users(Users)', { rA: true }),
    r.get('/users/:user_id(Users)', { r: true })
  ]

const api = BasefloorAPI({
  config: require('./basefloor.config.js')
})
```

## What is BasefloorAPI?

BasefloorAPI is the backend framework component of the **Basefloor ecosystem**. It's designed to be a powerful yet minimal API framework that handles all the common requirements of a modern API, allowing developers to focus on building their application's unique features rather than boilerplate code.

### The Basefloor Ecosystem

- **üèóÔ∏è BasefloorAPI** (this framework) - Backend API framework with authentication, database integration, and services
- **üé® BasefloorApp** (coming soon) - Vue.js frontend framework with components and utilities
- **‚öôÔ∏è Unified Config** - Single `basefloor.config.js` file configures both API and App

### With BasefloorAPI, you get:

- **Zero-config CRUD operations** - Define models and get full REST APIs automatically
- **Built-in authentication & permissions** - JWT-based auth with flexible permission rules  
- **File upload & processing** - Handle file uploads, conversions, and storage seamlessly
- **Email & notifications** - Send emails with multiple provider support
- **AI integration** - Built-in support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI services
- **Database abstraction** - Work with MongoDB through a simple, powerful interface
- **Extensive customization** - Override and extend any part of the framework

Whether you're building a simple REST API or a complex application backend, BasefloorAPI provides the foundation you need to get started quickly and scale effectively.
