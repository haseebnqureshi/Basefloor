# Interactive Tools

Welcome to the Basefloor interactive tools! These powerful utilities help you build, test, and understand Basefloor APIs without leaving the documentation.

> **ðŸ’¡ Environment Setup**
> 
> These tools work with both development (`http://localhost:3000`) and production (`https://api.yourdomain.com`) environments. Configure your base URL to match your setup.

## Available Tools

- Understanding request/response formats
- Debugging API calls
- Prototyping integrations

### ðŸ’» [Code Playground](/tools/code-playground)
Multi-language code examples with live execution and copy-paste ready snippets.

**Perfect for:**
- Learning by example
- Quick reference
- Language-specific implementations
- Copy-paste development

## Why Use These Tools?

### âš¡ **Faster Development**
Skip the setup phase and start building immediately with visual tools and live testing.

## Getting Started

1. **New to Basefloor?** Start with the [Configuration Builder](/tools/config-builder) to create your first config file
2. **Ready to test?** Use the [API Explorer](/tools/api-explorer) to make live API calls
3. **Need code examples?** Check out the [Code Playground](/tools/code-playground) for multi-language snippets

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- **API Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
- **Database**: Local MongoDB instance
- **CORS**: Allow localhost origins

### Production
- **API Base URL**: `https://api.yourdomain.com` (replace with your domain)
- **Database**: Cloud MongoDB (Atlas, etc.)
- **CORS**: Allow your production domains
- **SSL**: Required for production APIs
