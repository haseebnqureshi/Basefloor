# Interactive Components

> **📍 This page has moved!**
> 
> Interactive components are now organized in the dedicated **[Tools](/tools/)** section for better discoverability and organization.

## New Location

The interactive tools have been reorganized into focused, dedicated pages:

### 🔧 [Configuration Builder](/tools/config-builder)
Visual interface for creating Basefloor configuration files with real-time validation and export functionality.

### 🚀 [API Explorer](/tools/api-explorer)  
Live API testing interface that lets you make real HTTP requests directly from the documentation.

### 💻 [Code Playground](/tools/code-playground)
Multi-language code examples with copy-paste ready snippets for all major programming languages and frameworks.

## Why the Change?

We moved these tools to their own section because:

- **Better Discoverability**: Tools are now prominently featured in the main navigation
- **Focused Experience**: Each tool has its own dedicated page with comprehensive documentation
- **Improved Organization**: Clear separation between learning materials (Guide) and practical tools (Tools)

## Quick Access
